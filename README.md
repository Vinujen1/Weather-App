Weather App


Here’s a description you can use for your Weather App project on GitHub:

🌤️ Weather App
A React.js-based Weather App that provides real-time weather updates using WeatherAPI. This project allows users to search for a city and view live weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The application fetches data from WeatherAPI and dynamically updates the UI to reflect real-time changes.

The app was deployed to the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere. This project showcases my skills in React.js, API integration, and cloud deployment.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, CSS
API: WeatherAPI
Deployment: AWS/S3 (or specify the cloud service you used)
Features

Search Weather by City:
Users can enter the name of a city to retrieve weather data for that location.

Real-Time Weather Information:
The app fetches real-time weather data, including temperature, weather description, and a representative weather icon.

Dynamic User Interface:
The app features a modern and responsive design built with React, ensuring a smooth user experience.

API Integration:
Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate and real-time weather data.

Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js

API: OpenWeatherMap API

Styling: CSS

Hosting: AWS S3 (for static website hosting)

How It Works

Search Functionality:
Users enter a city name in the input field, and the app makes an API call to the OpenWeatherMap API.

Weather Data Retrieval:
The app retrieves the current temperature, weather condition, and an icon representing the weather.

Dynamic UI Rendering:
The weather data is displayed dynamically in the WeatherCard component.

Deployment

This project is designed to be hosted as a static website on AWS S3. The app is built using React and bundled into static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) using the npm run build command. These files are then uploaded to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.

Future Improvements

Add support for multiple languages.

Enhance the UI with additional weather details, such as wind speed and humidity.

Implement user location detection for automatic weather data retrieval.

Improve error handling for invalid city names.

This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of building a React app integrated with a third-party API and deploying it to AWS S3 for static hosting.
